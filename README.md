Project Requirements 
1. Loading Data
    Read Two data files 
        avgclsrmsal.csv and grad rates.csv

2. Clean and operate on the data while combining them
    Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, 
    then calculate some new values based on the new data set.  
        Removed columns before merge
        Merged on District name
        Removed null values
        Created a ratio betwen Salary and Graduation rates

3. Visualize / Present your data
    Make 3 matplotlib or seaborn (or another plotting library) visualizations to display your data.
        Mean Teacher Salary 
        Mean Graduation Rate
        Mean Ration between Salary and Graduation Rate

4. Best practices
    Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your 
    README on how the user should set one up

    Build a custom data dictionary and include it either in your README or as a separate document. 

5. Interpretation of your data. 
    Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, 
    and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t 
    have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. 
    Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
